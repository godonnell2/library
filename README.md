# library

we used a book constructor so that we can create new instances of book based on a book prototype
we created elements in html using the template and clone, this was a away to keep html and js separate and clean from each other.
however this meant we had to use map to change the dom elements into js for our function

had to get the input from the form using elements and value elements got us an array and the .value got us the value but watch out for check boxes and toggles need to use .checked to get the boolean value for these.
